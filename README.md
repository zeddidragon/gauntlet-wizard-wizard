Helps you manage your wizard in Gauntlet: Slayer Edition

== Usage ==

The app displays all the hotkeys for spells using the void school of magic with
a layout mimicking the buttons  needed on an XBox gamepad to invoke them.

When the right stick is tilted after selecting a spell, a cooldown bar
is displayed.

The window can be moved by dragging it. Ctrl-dragging will resize it.
